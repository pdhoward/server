## mongoStore App

A backend database server used strictly for prototyping data models and methods

The mongostore has a variety of end points for consumption in the metroplex messaging platform, including agents, clients and a complex context store for managing callbacks to AI platforms

Rather than in-memory db management (see dbstore), mongodb is used

The server also has hosts mapping applications, used in modeling route navigation and tracking for geofence messaging app use cases.

## Getting Set Up

Getting the app running on your local machine takes only a few steps:

1. clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/pdhoward/mongostore.git
2. install its dependencies - `npm install`
3. start the app - npm run start

## Backend Server

Note that a backend server is used strictly for prototyping

The set of methods mirrors mongoose methods
