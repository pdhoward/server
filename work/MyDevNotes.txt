MY DEVNOTES

-------------------

1. add a new schema called Client which models data/clients

use the schema Agent which models data/agents as a guide

2. update db/mongoose.js initialization routine inside of db.once .. to call the function for initializing the collection of clients

use initializeAgents as your guide

3. Test the functions. Open a mongodb terminal, drop the collections for agents and clients, and restart the server, validating that collections were created


mongo shell quick reference guide
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/

Some helpful mongodb commands include

show dbs
use <db name>
show collections
db.<collection>.count()
db.<collection>.find()
db.<collection>.drop()

4. Create a route and api (similar to agents) to render the clients collection on  webpage
